# About this project
I really enjoyed this opportunity and thank you for it. Couple of things to note.
-The measurements for the QR Codes said 4px by 4px so they would be large and legible. Think that must have been a typo so I made them 150 by 150.
-The button for screenshots did give me problems. I have a working button on the site but it is not doing what was asked. There was different documentation for different ways to solve this problem and with more time I think I could have solved it. I will have screenshots on the brain until I figure it out and I will get there.
